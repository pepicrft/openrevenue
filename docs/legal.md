# Legal & Licensing Notes

This project aims for API compatibility with common subscription SDK flows and payloads.

## SDK compatibility

OpenRevenue does not bundle proprietary SDKs. Client SDKs are installed by the application team, and OpenRevenue provides a compatible backend surface.

## Licensing

- Review the licenses of any SDKs you ship in your clients.
- Ensure your use of SDKs complies with their terms.
- Avoid using third-party trademarks or logos without permission.

## Practical guidance

- Use "compatible" language rather than brand-forward messaging.
- If you add new SDK compatibility layers, document their expected payloads.
- If a vendor does not publish trademark guidelines, stick to plain-text nominative references.

## Trademarks

Superwall, RevenueCat, and Adapty are trademarks of their respective owners. OpenRevenue is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by these companies.
